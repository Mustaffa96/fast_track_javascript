A switch statement is a control structure in programming that is used to evaluate an expression and execute different blocks of code based on the value of that expression. It provides an efficient way to handle multiple possible values or conditions in a concise and organized manner. The switch statement is commonly used in many programming languages, including JavaScript.

Here's the basic syntax of a switch statement in JavaScript:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression equals value2
    break;
  // More cases can be added as needed
  default:
    // Code to execute if none of the cases match the expression
}
```

Here's a breakdown of how the switch statement works:

1. The `expression` is evaluated, and its value is compared to each `case` label.

2. If a match is found between the `expression` and a `case` label, the code block following that `case` label is executed. The `break` statement is used to exit the switch statement once a match is found, preventing the execution of subsequent cases.

3. If none of the `case` labels match the `expression`, the code block following the `default` label (if present) is executed. The `default` case is optional and serves as a fallback for situations where none of the specific cases match the expression.

Here's an example based on the link you provided from W3Schools:

```javascript
var fruit = "Banana";

switch (fruit) {
  case "Apple":
    console.log("I love apples!");
    break;
  case "Banana":
    console.log("I enjoy bananas!");
    break;
  case "Cherry":
    console.log("Cherries are delicious!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I have no opinion on this fruit.");
}
```

In this example, the `fruit` variable is evaluated within the switch statement. Since `fruit` is set to "Banana," the code block following the "Banana" case label is executed, and the output will be "I enjoy bananas!"

If you were to change the value of `fruit` to "Apple," the output would change to "I love apples!" because it would match the "Apple" case label.

Switch statements are especially useful when you have multiple conditions to check and want to avoid writing a series of if-else statements. They make your code more readable and maintainable.
