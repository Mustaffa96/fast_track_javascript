In JavaScript, loops are control structures that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. One of the most commonly used loops is the "for" loop. The "for" loop is used to iterate over a range of values or elements in an array, performing a specific action for each iteration. Here's the general syntax of a "for" loop:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

Now, let's break down the components of a "for" loop:

1. Initialization: This part is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. It is used to initialize a counter variable or set the initial condition.

2. Condition: This is the test condition that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. If it's false, the loop terminates.

3. Increment/Decrement: This part is executed after each iteration and is typically used to update the counter variable. It can be an increment (e.g., `i++`) or a decrement (e.g., `i--`).

Now, let's see an example based on the W3Schools link you provided:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration " + i);
}
```

In this example:

- Initialization: `let i = 0` initializes a variable `i` to 0.
- Condition: `i < 5` checks if `i` is less than 5. If this condition is true, the loop continues.
- Increment: `i++` increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

So, this loop will execute five times, printing "Iteration 0" through "Iteration 4" to the console.

You can use "for" loops to iterate over arrays, perform specific tasks a certain number of times, or accomplish various repetitive tasks in your JavaScript code.
