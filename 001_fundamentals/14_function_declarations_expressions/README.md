Function Declaration and Function Expression are two ways to define functions in JavaScript. They have some key differences in how they are defined and hoisted, and they can be used in different situations.

1. **Function Declaration:**

   A function declaration defines a named function using the `function` keyword. It's typically hoisted to the top of its containing scope, which means you can call the function before it's defined in the code.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   }
   ```

   In this example, `greet` is a function declared using the `function` keyword. You can call it like this:

   ```javascript
   console.log(greet("John")); // Outputs: "Hello, John!"
   ```

   Function declarations are usually used for functions that need to be accessible throughout the entire scope, and you can call them anywhere in the code.

2. **Function Expression:**

   A function expression defines an anonymous function and assigns it to a variable. It is not hoisted, so you can only call the function after it has been defined in the code.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   var greet = function(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   };
   ```

   In this example, `greet` is a variable that holds an anonymous function. You can call it the same way as a function declaration:

   ```javascript
   console.log(greet("Jane")); // Outputs: "Hello, Jane!"
   ```

   Function expressions are often used when you need to assign a function to a variable or pass it as an argument to another function. They provide more flexibility in controlling the scope and when the function is created.

Here's a summary of the differences:

- **Hoisting:** Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope and can be called before they are defined. Function expressions are not hoisted, so you can only call them after they are defined.

- **Naming:** Function declarations have a name (e.g., `function greet(){}`), while function expressions can be anonymous (e.g., `var greet = function(){}`) or have a name (e.g., `var greet = function greet(){}`).

- **Usage:** Function declarations are typically used when you need to declare a function that should be available throughout the entire scope. Function expressions are often used for more specialized cases, like assigning functions to variables or passing them as arguments.
