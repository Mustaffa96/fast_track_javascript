Type conversion in JavaScript refers to the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to another. JavaScript automatically performs type conversion when you use a value in a way that's inconsistent with its current data type. This can be explicit, where you intentionally convert a value, or implicit, where JavaScript does it for you.

Here's a brief explanation of type conversion with an example based on W3Schools:

**Example:**
```javascript
var x = "10"; // x is a string
var y = 5;     // y is a number

var result = x + y; // JavaScript converts y to a string and performs concatenation
console.log(result); // Output will be "105" as the values are concatenated as strings

var a = "5";
var b = "3";

var sum = a + b; // JavaScript concatenates the strings
console.log(sum); // Output will be "53" because the values are treated as strings

var c = "Hello";
var d = 10;

var product = c * d; // JavaScript tries to convert "Hello" to a number, which results in NaN (Not-a-Number)
console.log(product); // Output will be NaN because the conversion is not possible
```

In the first example, JavaScript performs implicit type conversion when adding a string and a number, resulting in string concatenation. In the second example, when you add two strings, JavaScript concatenates them as well. In the third example, JavaScript attempts to convert a string ("Hello") to a number, but since it's not a valid conversion, it results in NaN. Type conversion is essential in JavaScript to handle different data types and perform operations accordingly.
