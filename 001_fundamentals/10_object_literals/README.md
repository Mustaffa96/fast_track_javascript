An object literal is a way to create and define objects in JavaScript directly within your code. It allows you to create key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or identifiers) and values can be any valid JavaScript data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, etc. Object literals are a simple and concise way to represent and organize data in your JavaScript code.

Here's the basic syntax of an object literal:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  // more key-value pairs...
};
```

Here's an example based on the W3Schools page you provided:

```javascript
// Creating an object literal for a person
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  hobbies: ["reading", "coding", "traveling"],
  address: {
    street: "123 Main Street",
    city: "New York",
    zipCode: "10001"
  },
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

// Accessing properties of the object
console.log("First Name: " + person.firstName); // Output: "First Name: John"
console.log("Age: " + person.age); // Output: "Age: 30"
console.log("Hobbies: " + person.hobbies.join(", ")); // Output: "Hobbies: reading, coding, traveling"
console.log("Street: " + person.address.street); // Output: "Street: 123 Main Street"
console.log("Full Name: " + person.fullName()); // Output: "Full Name: John Doe"
```

In this example, we've created an object literal called `person`, which contains various properties such as `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `hobbies`, and `address`. It also has a method `fullName` that returns the full name of the person by concatenating the `firstName` and `lastName` properties.

You can access the properties and methods of an object using dot notation (e.g., `person.firstName`) or square bracket notation (e.g., `person['firstName']`). Object literals are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are commonly used to structure and manage data in web applications.
