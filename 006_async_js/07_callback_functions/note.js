/*Callback functions are a fundamental concept in programming, often used in languages like JavaScript, Python, and others. They are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions, and they are executed at a specific point in the future or in response to a particular event. Here's a brief explanation of callback functions:

1. **Passing Functions as Arguments:** In languages that support first-class functions, you can pass functions as arguments to other functions just like you would with any other data type, such as numbers or strings.

2. **Deferred Execution:** Callback functions are typically not executed immediately when passed as arguments. Instead, they are "called back" or executed later, often when a certain condition is met or when an asynchronous operation completes. This allows for non-blocking and event-driven programming.

3. **Event Handling:** Callbacks are commonly used in event-driven programming, where you define a callback function to respond to specific events like button clicks, data fetching, or timers. When the event occurs, the associated callback function is invoked.

4. **Asynchronous Operations:** Callbacks are crucial in managing asynchronous operations, like reading files, making network requests, or handling user input. You can pass a callback to these operations to specify what should happen once the operation is finished.

5. **Error Handling:** Callbacks can also handle errors by passing an error object as one of the callback's arguments. This allows you to gracefully handle errors that might occur during an operation.

Example in JavaScript:*/


// Define a callback function
function processResult(result) {
  console.log("Result: " + result);
}

// Function that takes a callback
function performOperation(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    const result = 42;
    callback(result);
  }, 1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
}

// Calling the function with the callback
performOperation(processResult); // Callback will be executed after 1 second


/*In this example, `processResult` is a callback function that's passed to `performOperation`. `performOperation` will call the `processResult` callback after a simulated asynchronous delay.

Callback functions are a key building block for creating flexible and responsive code, especially in scenarios where the exact timing of events or operations is uncertain.*/
