});
/* This is the callback function that gets executed once the HTTP request is complete. It takes two parameters, err and posts, which will be populated based on the outcome of the HTTP request.

If there is an error during the request, the err parameter will contain an error message, and it will be logged to the console using console.log(err).

If the request is successful, the posts parameter will contain the response data (in this case, a list of posts), and it will be logged to the console using console.log(posts). */



/* So, when you run this code, it will send an HTTP GET request to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', and depending on the outcome of the request, it will either log an error or the retrieved list of posts to the console. 
This is a common pattern for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript, often used in web development to fetch data from APIs. */
